the music code is used to classify a music piece. It is a 4-class classification task.  
the 4 types of music denoted by: 1, 2, 3, 4
each data point composed by (X, y), X is feaure vector of size 24, y the data point label, values can be 1, 2, 3, 4.
 In total, there are 2000 data points, we randomly extract 1500 to train a MLP, 500 to test the trained MLP. In average can achieve an accuracy of 91%
